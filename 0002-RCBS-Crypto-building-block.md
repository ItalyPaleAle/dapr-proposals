# Crypto(graphy) building block

* Author(s): Alessandro Segala (@ItalyPaleAle)
* State: POC implemented (dapr/dapr#5429 and dapr/components-contrib#2237)

## Overview

This is a proposal for a new building block for Dapr to allow developers to leverage cryptography in a SAFE and consistent way. Goal is to expose an API that allows developers to ask Dapr to perform operations such as encrypting and decrypting messages, and calculating and verifying digital signatures.

### Business problem

Modern applications make extensive use of cryptography, which, when implemented correctly, can make solutions safer even in case data is compromised. Even more, in certain cases the use of crypto is required to comply with industry regulations (think banking) or even with legal requirements (GDPR). However, leveraging cryptography is hard: developers need to pick the right algorithms and options, and need to learn the proper way to manage and protect keys. Additionally, there are operational complexities when teams want to limit who has access to cryptographic key material.

Organizations have been increasingly started to leverage tools and services to perform crypto outside of applications. Examples include services such as Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, etc. Customers may also use on-prem HSM products like Thales Luna. While those products/services perform the same or very similar operations, their APIs are very different.

This is an area where Dapr can help. Just like we're offering an abstraction on top of secret stores, we can offer an abstraction layer on top key vaults.

### Solution overview

Benefits include:

- Making it easier for developers to perform cryptographic operations in a safe way. Dapr provides safeguards against using unsafe algorithms, or using algorithms with unsafe options.
- Keeping keys outside of applications. Applications never see key material, but can request the vault to perform operations with the keys.
- Allowing greater separation of concerns. By using external vaults, only authorized teams can access private/shared key materials.
- Simplify key management and key rotation. Keys are managed in the vault and outside of the application, and they can be rotated without needing the developers to be involved (or even without restarting the apps).
- Enabling better audit logging to monitor when operations are performed with keys in the vault.

### APIs: High-level vs subtle

The building block features 2 kinds of operations:

- Low-level or "subtle" (term frequently used to indicate low-level crypto operations; one example is how in browsers, low-level operations are in the [`crypto.subtle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto) object). These offer developers full control over the schemes that are used, allowing them to specify parameters, keys, modes of operations, etc.  
  As the "subtle" name implies, using these operations requires a certain level of understanding about what they do and how to use them safely; they are not meant to be consumed by the "general public".  
  Dapr offers these low-level operations for two reasons:
  1. Just like it is Dapr's value proposition to, for example, offer a consistent API abstracting various state stores, we will offer a consistent API to interface with key vaults. It allows using key vaults from multiple cloud providers, as well as using keys stored as Kubernetes secrets, all while interfacing with the same API.
  2. Developers working on applications that require interacting with existing and/or external solutions need these lower-level APIs to be able to maintain compatibility with them.
- High-level operations. At launch, these will cover data encryption and decryption only.  
  When using these higher-leel methods, Dapr offers a great level of abstraction. Developers just need to provide a key (symmetric or asymmetric) and can then use Dapr to encrypt/decrypt data without having to worry about anything else. Dapr will choose the best ciphers and modes of operations, offering access to an encryption scheme that is secure and flexible.

### Low-level APIs

The new building block will feature 7 low-level APIs:

- `encrypt`: encrypts arbitrary data using a key stored in the vault. It supports symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, depending on the type of key in use (and the types of keys supported by the vault).
- `decrypt`: decrypts arbitrary data, performing the opposite of what `/encrypt` does.
- `wrapkey`: wraps keys using other keys stored in the vault. This is exactly like encrypting data, but it expects inputs to be formatted as keys (for example formatted as JSON Web Key) and it exposes additional algorithms not available when encrypting general data (like AES-KW)
- `unwrapkey`: un-wraps (decrypts) keys, performing the opposite of what `/wrap` does
- `sign`: signs an arbitrary message using an asymmetric key stored in the vault (we could also consider offering HMAC here, using symmetric keys, although not widely supported by the vault services)
- `verify`: verifies a digital signature over an arbitrary message, using an asymmetric key stored in the vault (same: we may be able to offer HMAC too)
- `getkey`: this can be used only with asymmetric keys stored in the vault, and returns the public part of the key

### High-level APIs

The high-level APIs at launch will only include support for **encrypting** and **decrypting** messages (of arbitrary length), using the [Dapr encryption scheme](#dapr-encryption-scheme).

These APIs will only be available over gRPC, because they will work over a stream of data from the client. An HTTP implementation would require keeping the entire message in-memory, which is not acceptable.

### Components

Different components will be developed to perform those operations on supported backends such as the products/services listed above. Dapr would "translate" these calls into whatever format the backends require. Dapr never sees the private/shared keys, which remain safely stored inside the vaults.

Additionally, we will offer a "local" crypto component where keys are stored as Kubernetes secrets and cryptographic operations are performed within the Dapr sidecar. Although this is not as secure as using an external key vault, it still offers some benefits such as using standardized APIs and separation of concerns/roles with regards to key management.

Algorithms available will depend on what the backend vaults support, but in general developers should always find AES (encrypt/decrypt only) and RSA; when supported, we can offer also ChaCha20-Poly1305 (encrypt/decrypt only) and ECC with ECDSA or EdDSA (sign/verify only).

## Data flow: runtime and components

![data flow](./resources/0002-RCBS-Crypto-building-block/data-flow.png)

## Dapr encryption scheme: dapr.io/enc/v1

In the first version of the building block, we define 2 higher level operations to encrypt and decrypt data, in addition to low-level operations.

> **Sources:** The encryption scheme that Dapr uses is heavily inspired by the [Tink wire format](https://developers.google.com/tink/wire-format) (from the Tink library maintained by Google), as well as by Filippo Valsorda's [age](https://age-encryption.org/v1), and Minio's [DARE](https://github.com/minio/sio).

The Dapr encryption scheme is optimized for processing data as a stream. Data is chunked into multiple parts which are encrypted independently. This allows us to return data to callers as a stream, even when decrypting messages, being confident that we are not flushing unverified data to the client.

### Key

Each message is encrypted with a 256-bit symmetric **File Key (FK)** that is randomly generated by Dapr for each new message. The key must be generated as 32 byte of output from a CSPRNG (such as Go's `crypto/rand.Reader`) and must not be reused for other files.

The FK is wrapped using a key stored in a key vault (**Key Encryption Key (KEK)**) by Dapr. The result of the wrapping operation is the **Wrapped File Key (WFK)**.  The algorithm used depends on the type of the KEK as well as the algorithms supported by the component: in order of preference:

- Symmetric keys:
    - AES-KW ([RFC 3394](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3394.html)): `AES-KW`
    - AES-GCM: `AES-GCM`  
      The result of using AES-GCM is in the format `iv || wfk || tag`
- RSA keys:
    - RSA OAEP with SHA-256: `RSA-OAEP-256`

> In the future, we should explore how to add support for elliptic curve cryptography, for example Curve25519, which requires performing an ECDH key agreement.

### Ciphertext format

The ciphertext is formatted as:

```
header || binary payload
```

### Header

The **header** is human-readable and contains 4 items, each terminated by a line feed (0x0A) character:

1. Name and version of the encryption scheme used. Currently, this is always `dapr.io/enc/v1`
2. The algorithm used to wrap the file key, as well as any other parameters as needed (_currently unused, but will be needed for ECDH_)
3. The wrapped file key, base64-encoded
4. The MAC for the header, base64-encoded

> Base64 encoding follows [RFC 4648 ยง4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4) ("standard" format, with padding included but optional when decoding)

```
dapr.io/enc/v1
AES-KW
hGYjwDpWEXEymSTFZ95zgX8krElb3Gqyls67R8zJA3k=
pBDKLrhAWL7IAvDKBV/v7lmbTG6AEZbf3srUN0Pnn30=
```

The final line is the MAC for the header, which is computed with HMAC-SHA-256 over the previous 3 lines (including the final newline) with a key that is derived from the (plain-text) File Key with HKDF-SHA-256:

```
mac-key = HKDF-SHA-256(ikm = file key, salt = empty, info = "header")
MAC = HMAC-SHA-256(key = mac-key, message = first 3 lines of the header)
```

Note that there's one newline character (0x0A) at the end of the MAC, which concludes the header

### Binary payload

The binary payload begins immediately after the header (after the 4th newline character) and it includes the binary header and each segment of data encrypted:

```
binary header || segment_0 || segment_1 || ... || segment_k 
```

### Binary header

The binary header is 8-bytes long:

| Cipher suite | Nonce prefix |
| --- | --- |
| 1 byte | 7 bytes |
| `0x00`: AES-GCM <br>`0x01`: ChaCha20-Poly1305 ([RFC 8439](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8439)) | Random sequence of 7 bytes generated by a CSPRNG |

> Dapr will choose AES-GCM if running on a system that supports AES-NI CPU instructions, or ChaCha20-Poly1305 otherwise. We may change that behavior in the future.

### Segments

The plaintext is chunked into segments 64KB (65,536 bytes) each; the last segment may be shorter. Segments must never be empty, unless the entire file is empty.

Each segment of plaintext is encrypted independently and stored together with its tag:

```
encrypted chunk || tag
```

Segments are encrypted with a **Payload Key (PK)** that is derived from the (plain-text) File Key and the nonce prefix:

```
payload-key = HKDF-SHA-256(ikm = file key, salt = nonce prefix, info = "payload")
```

Each segment is encrypted using a different 12-byte nonce / initialization vector:

```
nonce_prefix || i || last_segment
```

Where: 

- `nonce_prefix` (7 bytes) is the nonce prefix from the binary header
- `i` (4 bytes) is the sequence number, as a 32-bit unsigned integer counter, encoded as big-endian. The first segment has sequence number 0, and it increases.
- `last_segment` (1 byte) is `0x01` if this is the last segment, or `0x00` otherwise

## Components

Components in dapr/components-contrib implement low-level primitives only, while all higher-level operations are performed by the runtime, so they are executed in a consistent way across all backends/services. This is because the job of the components is limited to actually interacting with the key vaults, and everything else is best handled by the runtime.

Components are to be placed in the `crypto` folder and must implement the `SubtleCrypto` interface:

```go
import "github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2/jwk"

// SubtleCrypto offers an interface to perform low-level ("subtle") cryptographic operations with keys stored in the vault
type SubtleCrypto interface {

        // True if the signature is valid
        valid bool,
        // Error
        err error,
    )
}
```

A few notes about all methods above:

1. Keys are passed as `jwk.Key` objects, from the (excellent) [lestrrat-go/jwx library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2)
1. The `algorithm` should be represented as constant as defined by [RFC 7518 ("JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)")](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html). For the most part, Dapr components should not try to parse the value submitted by the user (unless the component is the "local" one that performs crypto operations directly), and pass whatever value directly to the key vault.
1. The `key` parameter can contain a version if keys can be versioned in the vault. The format should be `name/version`. If no version is specified, it's assumed to be the latest.

Notes on `WrapKey` and `UnwrapKey`:

1. If the key need to be encoded (common with asymmetric keys), it needs to be encoded before being passed to the component. For example, in the runtime, RSA keys may be represented in a [`rsa.PrivateKey` object](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/rsa#PrivateKey), and need to be encoded in PKCS#1 format. Symmetric keys can be passed as-is, as they are normally stored in a byte slice already.
1. `WrapKey` and `UnwrapKey` can be implemented on top of `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` if the underlying key vault does not have a special operation for key wrapping/unwrapping. 

Notes on `Encrypt` and `Verify`:

1. When using an asymmetric key, these operations can be performed using the public key without hitting the key vault. However, for consistency and to ensure that we always use the last version of the key, components should always perform them in the vault. Exception could be if the key has a specific version, in which case components may opt to download the public key, cache it, and perform the operation locally.

## gRPC APIs

In the Dapr gRPC APIs, we are extending the `runtime.v1.Dapr` service to add new methods:

```proto

The `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` methods are stream-based. Dapr will read from the client until it has sufficient data, and will then send back the encrypted/decrypted data to the client. Clients must thus both send data to the RPC and listen for incoming messages. SDKs can offer to consumer methods to read the data as a stream (e.g. in Go, they accept an `io.Reader` and return an `io.Reader`)

## HTTP APIs

The HTTP APIs are developed in a way that is the exact "port" of the gRPC "subtle" APIs, and the contents of the request and response bodies match exactly the fields in the gRPC APIs.

Methods are:

- `/v1.0/subtlecrypto/getkey` ->  SubtleGetKey
- `/v1.0/subtlecrypto/encrypt` ->  SubtleEncrypt
- `/v1.0/subtlecrypto/decrypt` ->  SubtleDecrypt
- `/v1.0/subtlecrypto/wrapkey` ->  SubtleWrapKey
- `/v1.0/subtlecrypto/unwrapkey` ->  SubtleUnwrapKey
- `/v1.0/subtlecrypto/sign` ->  SubtleSign
- `/v1.0/subtlecrypto/verify` ->  SubtleVerify

**Currently, higher-level APIs are not offered via HTTP**. This is because it's not possible, using HTTP, to have a stream where Dapr sends back data to the client before the client's request is complete. Without that, we'd have to buffer the entire data in-memory in the runtime, which would be not practical when encrypting very large files.
